# Noise Control
**Noise Control has been discontinued. There will be no more development in this repo.**

This Firefox add-on shows an icon in the tab of each tab currently playing an HTML5 video or audio.

It also shows an icon when a plugin (such as Flash) is active on a page, because there's no way to tell if a plugin is making noise.
